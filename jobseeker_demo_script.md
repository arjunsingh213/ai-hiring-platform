## SCRIPT

**[0:00 - 0:15 | Opening & Landing Page]**

Hey everyone! Today I'm going to walk you through Froscel—an AI-powered hiring platform designed for job seekers. Let me type in froscel.com and show you how it works.

So here's our landing page. It's built for both recruiters and job seekers. Let me show you the job seeker journey today.

**[0:15 - 0:35 | Signup Process]**

I'll click on "Sign Up" and select "Job Seeker" as my role. Now I'll enter my email, create a password, and hit "Create Account."

A verification email has been sent to my inbox. Let me quickly open that... and click "Verify Email Address." And we're verified!

**[0:35 - 1:00 | Resume Auto-fill Feature]**

The platform is asking me how I'd like to complete my profile. I have two options—upload my resume for auto-fill, or fill everything manually.

I'm going with "Auto-fill with Resume" since it saves time. Let me select my resume from local storage...

**[1:00 - 1:25 | Profile Setup - Basic Info]**

And there we go—the application has parsed my resume and extracted my skills, experience, and education automatically.

Now I just need to fill in a few personal details—my name, age, date of birth, and mobile number. Let me also upload a profile photo by clicking this icon...

**[1:25 - 1:50 | Face Verification]**

The system uses real-time camera access to verify that the photo I uploaded matches my actual face. This prevents fake profiles on the platform and ensures authenticity.

Once verified, I'll click "Next" to continue.

**[1:50 - 2:20 | Profile Setup - Professional Info]**

Step two is about my professional preferences. I'll select my desired role—Software Engineer. And for the domains I'm interested in, I'm choosing Marketing and Software Engineering.

Notice how my skills and college name are already auto-filled from my resume? I can edit these if needed. Let me click "Next."

**[2:20 - 2:35 | Social Profiles - Optional]**

Step three is optional—linking my social profiles like LinkedIn and GitHub. This gives recruiters a more complete picture. For now, I'll skip this and move on.

**[2:35 - 2:55 | Complete Onboarding & Platform Interview]**

Step four—I'll click "Complete Onboarding."

Now this popup is asking if I want to take the platform-specific interview now or skip it for later.

Here's why this matters: This interview is powered by AI and it's personalized based on your resume—your skills, your projects, your experience level. If you're a technical candidate, you'll get technical questions. If you're in marketing or customer support, the questions will match your domain.

I'm going to click "Let's Go" because this interview impacts my ATP score—I'll explain that shortly.

**[2:55 - 3:20 | Interview Readiness Page]**

Before starting, there's an Interview Preparation page. Here I can check my camera, microphone, and internet connection to make sure everything's working.

You can see the interview structure on the left— Each round has 5 questions based on my profile.

I also need to accept the interview declaration—consenting to video recording. I'll click "Accept & Start Interview."

**[3:20 - 4:00 | Interview - First Round]**

First question—this is the Intro & Background round. There's a "Listening" button at the bottom which is a speech-to-text feature. I can speak my answer and it converts to text automatically, which is helpful if you prefer talking over typing.

The question is asking about my background with Python, Java, and GCP—pulled directly from my resume.

Let me answer this... and click "Next Question."

I'll continue through a few more questions here...

**[4:00 - 4:25 | Interview - Technical Rounds]**

Now I'm in the Technical Fundamentals round. These questions go deeper into technical knowledge. I'll answer these directly...

And now the third round—Practical Application. I'll skip ahead to the final question to save time...

One thing to note: The interview rounds adapt based on your profile. If your resume shows non-technical experience—like customer support, HR, or marketing—the rounds and questions will be different. The AI adjusts everything to match your background.

**[4:25 - 4:50 | Coding Round]**

Since my resume showed coding skills, the platform includes a coding round. This is a full coding environment where I can write, run, and test my code.

Not everyone gets this round—it only appears when the AI detects programming skills in your profile. Let me write some code... run it... and submit.

**[4:50 - 5:10 | Dashboard Overview]**

Done with the interview. Now let me take you to the dashboard.

This is the home page—it works like a social feed where you can see activity in your professional network. Your stats are up top—applications, interviews, profile views, and your Talent Score.

On the right, there's a "Top Candidates" section showing top performers in your domain of interest. You can connect with them and grow your network.

**[5:10 - 5:45 | Profile & ATP Feature]**

Let me click on "Profile" to show you the AI Talent Passport, or ATP.

This is where it gets interesting. Think of ATP as your verified professional identity. Unlike resumes that can be exaggerated, or LinkedIn profiles with inflated experiences, the ATP holds only verified skills and real achievements. It's built through your actual interview performance, not just claims on paper.

Recruiters trust ATP scores because they're based on real AI-evaluated interviews. A high ATP score makes you more visible to recruiters. It helps genuine talent stand out from the crowd.

**[5:45 - 6:10 | Interviews Section]**

Now let me head to the "Interviews" section. Here you can see all your interviews—pending and completed. You can track your progress and view detailed scores for completed interviews.

Let me click on the platform interview I just completed...

Here's the breakdown: I scored 77 out of 100 overall. Technical Accuracy—77%, Communication—72%, Confidence—77%, Relevance—77%. The coding round is at 0% since I rushed through it for the demo.

This feedback shows you exactly where you excel and where you can improve.

**[6:10 - 6:40 | Jobs Section]**

Now the "Jobs" section. This shows job listings based on your domain interests. 

With a higher ATP score, you become more visible to recruiters since they can filter candidates by ATP. In future updates, there'll be programs, tests, and activities to help you boost your ATP score.

Let me apply to this job by clicking "Apply Now."

**[6:40 - 7:00 | Job-Specific Interview]**

This takes me to another interview readiness page. Notice that the rounds here are different from the platform interview. These rounds are set by the recruiter specifically for this role.

If a recruiter wants a screening round followed by a coding challenge—that's what you'll get.

Let me start this interview, answer the questions, and move to the coding round...

**[7:00 - 7:20 | Job Interview Results]**

Submitted. The AI evaluates my performance and generates a detailed report. This report goes to the recruiter, who can then decide if I'm the right fit for the role.

I can view these results anytime from my "Completed Interviews" section.

**[7:20 - 7:26 | Closing]**

And that's the job seeker experience on Froscel—from AI-powered interviews to verified talent passports, built to help genuine talent get noticed.
